### Use multiple accounts of cloud storage in the PC

Google Drive, OneDrive and other cloud services use only one account in the PC.

You use corporate Google Drive account at work.  You might use your personal Google Drive account at work as well.  In short, you will need to use multiple accounts in the PC at the same time, but it is not available in Google Drive.

However, you can manage this with NetDrive.  It allows to use multiple Google Drive accounts in the same PC at the same time.
