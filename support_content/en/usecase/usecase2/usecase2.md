### Easy file share and collaboration

You can share files with your team members using any method described below.

-	Send email with the file attached
-	Attach the file to bulletin board or a forum
-	Inform the path or shareable link after uploading the file to cloud storage or file server

It is very inconvenient to attach the file to the email or the bulletin board.  You need to upload and download each time you need to share with others.

You can share the file using shareable link provided by any cloud services but it is troublesome as well.  You need to upload and download each time.

You can inform the file location of the file server to your members, but it is highly possible to get corrupted if multiple members use the file at the same time.
