When you complete the login using Amazon account, Amazon Drive will be connected as a virtual drive to your PC.  Then you will see "CONNECT", "DISCONNECT", "OPTIONS" and "BROWSE" buttons in NetDrive Application.

It would take more than 10 minutes to receive initial connection information when you generate the drive for the first time.


OPTIONS
==================
You can control bandwidth of the drive if you click "OPTIONS".
